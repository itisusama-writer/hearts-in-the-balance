Title: "Chapter One - The New Assignment"
---

Sophia Lane leaned back in her chair, her gaze fixed on the ceiling tiles of the sleek corner office she’d fought tooth and nail to earn. The hum of the city outside was faint, muffled by the glass windows that stretched from floor to ceiling, giving her a panoramic view of downtown. Yet, the view was hardly a comfort this morning. On her desk, the email notification glared back at her, its subject line a harbinger of chaos:

**Team Project: Lane & Carter**

Sophia sighed. Carter. Of all people. The office’s golden boy, with his endless charm and his maddening ability to breeze through deadlines while barely breaking a sweat. He was the antithesis of everything she stood for—meticulous planning, rigorous execution, and absolute focus. If success was a ladder, she’d climbed each rung with precision; Carter seemed to have taken an elevator to the top.

Her phone buzzed, dragging her out of her thoughts.

“Soph, did you see it?” came a familiar voice. It was Mia, her best friend and fellow coworker.

“Unfortunately,” Sophia muttered, rubbing her temples.

“Hey, it’s not all bad,” Mia teased. “I mean, Carter’s not hard to look at. And rumor has it you two have *chemistry*.”

“The only chemistry we have is explosive,” Sophia shot back. “And not the good kind. Remember the merger pitch?”

“How could I forget? I thought HR was going to have to mediate. But maybe this time will be different,” Mia said hopefully. “New project, new possibilities.”

Sophia wasn’t convinced. She glanced at the clock. Ten minutes until the meeting to discuss their assignment.

When she arrived in the glass-walled conference room, Carter was already there, lounging in a chair like he owned the place. His tailored suit looked as effortless as his smirk.

“Morning, Lane,” he greeted, his tone hovering somewhere between polite and teasing.

“Carter,” she replied coolly, setting her tablet down on the table.

“Excited to work together?” he asked, leaning forward, his dark eyes dancing with mischief.

“Thrilled,” she deadpanned.

Before Carter could respond, their boss, Mr. Harrington, strode in. He was a no-nonsense man in his late fifties, and the stern expression on his face did little to ease Sophia’s nerves.

“Lane, Carter,” Harrington began, “You’ve both proven yourselves individually. Now I want to see what you can do as a team. This project is high stakes, and I’m trusting you two to make it a success.”

Sophia nodded, her resolve hardening. She’d make this work, no matter how much Carter’s presence grated on her nerves.

“Of course,” she said.

Carter flashed a grin. “Consider it done.”

As they left the room, Carter fell into step beside her. “So, Lane, any ideas on how we’re going to survive this?”

She stopped and turned to face him, her hazel eyes narrowing. “We’re going to keep it professional. No games, no shortcuts. Got it?”

Carter raised his hands in mock surrender. “Whatever you say, boss.”

Sophia didn’t dignify that with a response. Instead, she walked away, her mind already racing with plans for their first brainstorming session. She might not like Carter, but she wasn’t about to let their differences derail her goals. If this was a battle of wills, she intended to win.
