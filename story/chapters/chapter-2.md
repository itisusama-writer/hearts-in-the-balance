Sophia spent the rest of the morning drafting a project outline. Her desk was a sea of sticky notes, highlighters, and carefully organized printouts. She took a deep breath, double-checking her presentation slides. If Carter wanted to play it fast and loose, she’d counter with preparation and precision.

At exactly 2:00 PM, she arrived at the meeting room they’d reserved for their first brainstorming session. Unsurprisingly, Carter was already there, leaning back in a chair with his phone in hand, scrolling through something that made him grin. 

“Nice of you to show up early,” Sophia remarked, placing her laptop on the table.

He looked up, unfazed. “I aim to please. So, what’s the plan, Lane? Are we starting with an icebreaker or diving straight into business?”

She rolled her eyes. “We’re here to work. I’ve outlined some key objectives based on Harrington’s brief. Let’s focus on those.”

“Always so serious,” Carter teased, but he set his phone aside and straightened up. “Okay, hit me with it.”

Sophia launched into her presentation, clicking through slides that detailed timelines, deliverables, and contingency plans. Carter watched with an unreadable expression, occasionally nodding but saying little.

When she finished, she folded her arms. “Thoughts?”

Carter leaned forward, resting his elbows on the table. “It’s thorough. I’ll give you that. But don’t you think it’s a little… rigid? Projects like this need flexibility. What if we hit a roadblock and need to pivot?”

“That’s why we have contingency plans,” Sophia replied, her tone clipped. 

“Plans are great,” Carter said, “but sometimes you have to trust your instincts and adapt on the fly. Not everything can be mapped out in advance.”

Sophia bristled. “Flying by the seat of your pants isn’t a strategy.”

“And over-planning can kill creativity,” Carter shot back, his tone light but his gaze steady. 

They stared at each other for a moment, the tension thickening. Finally, Carter leaned back with a shrug. 

“Tell you what,” he said. “We’ll do it your way for now. But if things start to derail, we’ll try mine. Deal?”

Sophia hesitated. She didn’t like conceding even an inch, but she also knew they’d get nowhere if they kept butting heads. 

“Fine,” she said. “But don’t say I didn’t warn you.”

“Wouldn’t dream of it,” Carter said with a grin.

As they dove into the specifics of the project, Sophia couldn’t shake the feeling that this was only the beginning of a long, challenging partnership. But one way or another, she’d prove that her way was the best way—even if it meant working alongside the most infuriating man in the office.
