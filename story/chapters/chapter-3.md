The conference room had emptied, but the tension lingered. Sophia’s laptop hummed softly as she packed up her things, her fingers lingering on the cool metal surface. Across the table, Carter leaned back in his chair, watching her with an expression she couldn’t quite place.

“Long day,” he said, his voice softer now, the usual teasing edge gone.

“You could say that,” she replied without looking at him, focusing instead on organizing her notes.

Carter stood, his movements deliberate, and walked to the window. The city lights cast a warm glow across his face as he looked out, hands in his pockets. “You ever wonder why Harrington paired us up?”

Sophia paused, her hand hovering over her bag. “I assumed it was to punish me,” she said lightly, but the words lacked their usual bite.

He chuckled, turning to face her. “Maybe he saw something we don’t. Some kind of… potential.”

She met his gaze, her heartbeat quickening despite herself. “Potential for disaster, maybe.”

Carter stepped closer, closing the distance between them. The air between them seemed to hum with an unspoken energy, a pull neither of them could ignore. “Or something else,” he said, his voice low.

Sophia’s breath hitched as she looked up at him, the lines between rivalry and something deeper beginning to blur. “Carter…” she began, but the words caught in her throat.

“Relax, Lane,” he said, his lips curving into a slow smile. “We’re just talking.”

“Is that what we’re doing?” she asked, her voice quieter now.

His hand brushed hers as he reached for the edge of the table, and the brief contact sent a spark through her. She pulled back instinctively, her cheeks flushing.

“See you tomorrow, Lane,” Carter said, his voice laced with something that sounded suspiciously like a promise.

Sophia watched him leave, her heart pounding in her chest. For the first time, she wondered if their battle of wills wasn’t the only thing between them—and what might happen if they crossed that line.
